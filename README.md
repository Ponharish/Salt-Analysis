# Salt Analysis 

## What is this?

This application is an educational tool built using Python and Tkinter. 
It guides the students step-by-step through standard laboratory tests 
to help identify the **cation and anion** present in a given salt sample.

---

## Main Features

- An extensive step-by-step guide for the various tests for detecting ions.
- Separate tests for **Anions** and **Cations**.
- Step-by-step **test procedures** and **expected observations**.
- Helpful guide to see possible tests and results for each ion.
- Restart button to begin a new test sequence anytime.

## How to Use

### 1. **Launch the App**
When the app opens, it shows the title "Salt Analysis" and a menu.


### 2. **Test for Anion**

Click the **“Test Anion”** button to begin analyzing the anion (negative ion):

- You will be shown a series of tests:
  - Solubility
  - Reaction with H₂SO₄
  - BaCl₂ Test
  - AgNO₃ Test
  - Chromyl Chloride Test
  - Brown Ring Test
  - ...and more
- For each test, choose the result that matches your observation.
- After all tests are selected, click **“Submit”**.
- The program will try to deduce the anion and display it.

### 3. **Test for Cation**

Click the **“Test Cation”** button to identify the cation (positive ion):

- Similar to anion testing, it shows:
  - Flame test
  - Group reagent tests
  - Confirmatory tests using color, precipitate, and smell
- Select the result of each test.
- Click **“Submit”** to get the identified cation.

### 4. **See Tests & Results**

Want to learn what tests correspond to a specific ion?

Click **“Tests and Results”**:

- Select whether you want to see results for **Anion** or **Cation**.
- Then pick the specific ion from the dropdown.
- Click **“Check”** to see the full list of tests and the **expected observations** that confirm the presence of that ion.

This is great for **learning and revision**!

### 5. **Restart**

Click the **“Restart”** button at the bottom to clear all current selections and start fresh.
